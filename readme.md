# Classic HTML5 Flappy Bird built with Javascript

The original version of this addicting game caused quite a stir about a year after it was released for mobile devices in 2013. That's when it suddenly skyrocketed to popularity. Gamers around the world were drawn to Flappy Bird‘s frustratingly simple concept and found themselves unable to stop playing it.

Dong Nguyen, the game’s creator, eventually removed it from both Google Play and the Apple App Store because he reportedly felt it had become too addictive and overplayed. Critics also pointed out that its graphics were very similar to those featured in Nintendo’s famous Super Mario series, even going so far as to call them a complete ripoff. Since the game's debut, it's spawned other Flappy Bird games and even parodies featuring everybody from Sesame Street and meme characters to the members of famous rock bands.
